## SpaceGazing
SpaceGazing is a web application where you can explore mesmerizing space photos
from NASA. Each day brings a new picture, and you can search to see what image was
featured on a specific date. Take the opportunity to read the image info and expand
your knowledge of the cosmos. But it does not end there, create personalized
collections of your favorite images, and enjoy creating your own gallery of the milky
way and beyond. The universe is the limit!
